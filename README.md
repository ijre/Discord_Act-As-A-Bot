known issues:

1. bot doesn't come online despite still being able to talk
2. can't actually switch channels (yet)
3. channel/server selecting is really funky
4. i have no fucking clue which id.txt the C++ portion is reading from for the bot's token, there's like 4 different "id.txt"'s lying around the repo
